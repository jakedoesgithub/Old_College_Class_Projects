  <h2>
	About
  </h2>
  <p>
	A large amount of LSU students are commuters, and with being a commuter comes certain complications. One of the more pressing difficulties, aside from sometimes hour long trips and Baton Rouge traffic, is not knowing whether or not a parking space will be available when they arrive. That's where we come in. Using user-supplied data, Tiger Parking can pull up an approximate rating for LSU's parking lots, allowing commuters to check the availability of parking lots before even heading out the door.
  </p>
  <h2>
	How To Use
  </h2>
  <p>
	If you know which lot you want to try parking in, go to Ratings and click on the lot you want. Doing this will pull up the average rating of the lot's accessability from 1 to 5 (1 being rather empty and 5 being filled to the brim). If you don't know which lot you want to park in or your preferred lot is full, head to the Suggestions page and type the name of the building you need to go to in the search bar in the top left. This will suggest lots near the building and a relative description of their current capacity.
  </p>
  <h2>
	How To Rate
  </h2>
  <p>
	If you're feeling generous and want to help keep ratings accurate, you can submit a rating for a parking lot by going to the ratings page, clicking the lot you want to rate, click "Add Rating", then choose the option that best describes the lot's capacity from 1 to 5.
